# VR Drum machine

Three physical controls:
- **Slider** controls beats per minute (20-200)
- **Buttons** on the grid set which beat a drum should play on (8 beats horizontally, 5 drums vertically)
- **Dials** on the left control the volume of each drum (this control is still a little wonky, but it works)
